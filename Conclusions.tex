\section{Conclusion}
An extensive irradiation campaign at CERN and a test beam at the Fermilab test beam facility have verified the functionality of the CBC3, the final prototype ASIC for the CMS OT 2S modules. The measurements have shown the CBC3 to be capable of withstanding HL-LHC radiation levels, and have demonstrated the CBC3's ability to identify high ${p_T}$ tracks with high efficiency. 

A radiation damage model has been developed, using data collected during the irradiations, to predict the expected increase in power consumption for HL-LHC operation. The maximum expected current increase in the CBCs would increase power consumption of a 2S module by approximately 20 mW (there are ${\times16}$ CBCs per 2S module ) which corresponds to a less than ${1}$\% increase in the total power consumption of a module.
