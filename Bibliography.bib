  abstract={The increase of the leakage current of NMOS transistors during exposure to ionizing radiation is known and well studied. Radiation hardness by design techniques have been developed to mitigate this effect and have been successfully used. More recent developments in smaller feature size technologies do not make use of these techniques due to their drawbacks in terms of logic density and requirement of dedicated libraries. During operation the resulting increase of the supply current is a serious challenge and needs to be considered during the system design. A simple parametrization of the leakage current of NMOS transistors as a function of total ionizing dose is presented. The parametrization uses a transistor transfer characteristics of the parasitic transistor along the shallow trench isolation to describe the leakage current of the nominal transistor. Together with a parametrization of the number of positive charges trapped in the silicon dioxide and number of activated interface traps in the silicon to silicon dioxide interface the leakage current results as a function of the exposure time to ionizing radiation. This function is fitted to data of the leakage current of single transistors as well as to data of the supply current of full ASICs.}

  abstract={Tracking detectors in particle physics experiments allow a precise reconstruction of particle tracks close to the interaction point and the identification of primary and secondary decay vertices. In order to evaluate the performance of detector prototypes for future particle physics experiments — at hadron colliders (e.g. HL-LHC), flavour factories (e.g. SuperKEKB) or a future lepton collider (e.g. ILC) — under realistic conditions, a fast readout reference device, a telescope, with excellent resolution and modular configuration, is required. The successful development of a telescope with these characteristics was part of the EU-project EUDET, which is continued within the framework of the AIDA activity. One key addition to the telescope within AIDA is the implementation of at least one new reference plane dedicated to provide an adjustable geometry. This plane is realized with a hybrid pixel detector consisting of a sensor bump bonded to the ATLAS pixel readout chip FE-I4. Its masking capability allows the definition of a user-defined region-of-interest (ROI) trigger area, that can be tuned to match the area defined by the device under test (DUT). Such a flexible setup is presented and the operation is demonstrated using a DEPFET pixel sensor as DUT in between the two telescope arms. The data acquisition (DAQ) for this small area DUT is improved in terms of trigger efficiency by more than a factor of three with respect to the standard telescope configuration. The integration of the DUT into the telescope and the online results obtained with it using the ROI trigger will be shown.}

  abstract={A testbeam telescope, based on ATLAS IBL silicon pixel modules, has been built. It comprises six planes of planar silicon sensors with 250 × 50 μ m 2 pitch, read out by ATLAS FE-I4 chips. In the CERN SPS H8 beamline (180 GeV π + ) a resolution of better than 8 × 12 μm 2 at the position of the device under test was achieved. The telescope reached a trigger rate of 6 kHz with two measured devices. It is mainly designed for studies using FE-I4 based prototypes, but has also been successfully run with independent DAQ systems. Specialised trigger schemes ensure data synchronisation between these external devices and the telescope. A region-of-interest trigger can be formed by setting masks on the first and the last pixel sensor planes. The setup infrastructure provides centrally controlled and monitored high and low voltage power supplies, silicon oil cooling, temperature and humidity sensors and movable stages.}

  abstract={The ATLAS collaboration will upgrade its semiconductor pixel tracking detector with a new Insertable B-layer (IBL) between the existing pixel detector and the vacuum pipe of the Large Hadron Collider. The extreme operating conditions at this location have necessitated the development of new radiation hard pixel sensor technologies and a new front-end readout chip, called the FE-I4. Planar pixel sensors and 3D pixel sensors have been investigated to equip this new pixel layer, and prototype modules using the FE-I4A have been fabricated and characterized using 120 GeV pions at the CERN SPS and 4 GeV positrons at DESY, before and after module irradiation. Beam test results are presented, including charge collection efficiency, tracking efficiency and charge sharing.}

  Abstract = {Forthcoming hardware upgrades to the \{CMS\} experiment trigger and readout system are based upon the \{ATCA\} or μTCA bus standards, giving them the opportunity to be controlled via commodity gigabit Ethernet. These hardware upgrades supersede existing systems largely based upon the VME-bus standard, and thus a requirement has arisen to provide a new low-level control infrastructure for use by trigger and readout subsystem developers. This paper details the recent research and development into a tightly-integrated suite of software and firmware based upon the \{IPbus\} protocol that allows such Ethernet-attached hardware to be controlled in an efficient and highly-scalable manner. },
